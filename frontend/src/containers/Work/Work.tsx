            It is a <span className='red'>fullstack</span> application build with MERN stack.
            Its current functionality is creation of <span className='red'>unique characters</span> by usage of custom made assets.
            <br/> <br/>
            These assets are made by users and then <span className='red'>shared</span> with community for others to use or get inspired by.
            <br/><br/>
            Characters are made in just a few clicks and are ready for immediate play.
            Currently in development are <span className='red'>adventure</span> and <span className='red'>map</span> creation features.
