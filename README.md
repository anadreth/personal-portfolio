<h1>Personal Website</h1>

<p>
This is my personal website in which I showcase my work and resume.
<br>
I build it with React, Typescript, Sass, Framer Motion and designed it in Photoshop, Figma and Canva.
<br><br>
It was quite an entarataining process during which firstly encountered typescript errors xD. 
<br>
Also making it responsible with custom made background images was quite a challenge.
<br><br>
Feel free to leave any feedback as I do not really know if I am fully satisfied with design of work section!
<br>
I would love to improve it as much as possible.
